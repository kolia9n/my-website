            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a chef with 15 years of experience, specializing in modern English and French haute cuisines. My culinary journey has taken me across several continents, learning from native chefs and mastering a variety of techniques. I am dedicated to creating unique dishes, especially fusion cuisine, where each ingredient on the plate harmoniously engages with the others.</p>

        <section id="culinary-journey" class="culinary-journey">
            <h2 class="section-title">Culinary Journey</h2>
            <p>In the UK, I worked at a one Michelin star and a two Michelin stars restaurant, showcasing my mastery in modern English and French haute cuisines. I am the youngest in my family of five involved in hospitality to join the chefs' guild. I have dreamed of being the best chef since I was 13 years old. I have traveled to several continents to learn more techniques and fundamental knowledge from native chefs around the world. I lived in Mainland China for seven years in the southern, northern, and eastern regions, and during this time, I also visited different Asian countries such as Cambodia, Thailand, Japan, and Hong Kong.</p>
